# The Prospecting Challenge Nobody Cracked… Until Now

Anyone who has ever tried to track down the perfect lead knows the struggle.  
You tweak filters in a CRM, download a list, and—half the entries don’t fit.  
The rest? Wrong job titles, missing contact info, or companies that no longer fit your ICP.

Instead of closing deals, sales teams spend hours cleaning data.  
This isn’t a CRM issue—it’s a **prospecting issue**. That’s why we created **VectorDB**.

---

## What Sets VectorDB Apart

VectorDB is more than “just another CRM.”  
It’s designed for **prospecting first** with two powerful tools: **People Search** and **Company Search**, both built on real-time data enrichment.

---

## 1. People Search: Find the Right Contact Instantly

No more endless scrolling. With VectorDB, you zero in on the exact people you want by filtering on:

- Job Title  
- Company  
- Location  
- Team Size  
- Industry  

**How it works:**

1. Apply filters  
2. Get instant results  
3. Save contacts you want  

Your results are split into:  

- **Total** → all results  
- **New** → fresh contacts not seen before  
- **Saved** → your personal lead library  

And when you’re ready, you can export everything in **one click**.

## 2. Company Search: Build a List That Matches Your ICP

Good leads start with the right companies.  
With the same filtering engine as People Search, you can quickly assemble a list of businesses that match your target profile.  

Features include:  

- Saved filters for recurring use  
- New, Saved, and Total views  
- Easy exports (up to 500 per day, shared between people + companies)

---

## 3. Saved Filters: Prospecting Without Rework

Why repeat the same setup every week?  
With VectorDB, you can save any filter combination and reuse it—perfect for consistent campaigns or refreshing the same market segment.

---

## 4. Enrichment: Data That Stays Alive

Data goes stale faster than ever: job changes, role shifts, bounced emails.  
VectorDB automatically enriches your saved data so you don’t lose momentum.

You’ll instantly see:

- **Job Changes** → alerts when contacts move roles  
- **Missing Emails** → gaps filled with verified addresses  

And you can refresh everything manually with a single click.

---

## Why Teams Love VectorDB

- **Speed** → from search to export in under a minute  
- **Accuracy** → intent-based filtering, not keyword noise  
- **Freshness** → enrichment keeps contacts alive  
- **Organization** → clear separation of new vs saved data  

---

## Final Takeaway

Traditional CRMs only **store** data.  
**VectorDB discovers it, updates it, and keeps it fresh.**

When timing makes the difference between a cold email and a closed deal, that edge matters.
